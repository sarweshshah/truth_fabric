# Fabric of Truth

Interactive installation where users interacts with a fabric to trigger a text animation.
Interactions are gesture and tactile based and are detected with a Kinect2 sensor.

### Iteration 1: 
`TextAnimation` class to define the animation that will be played on the screen. Trigger is currently is mouse click based.
The code captures mouse position and plays the animation accordingly.

### Iteration 2:
Added static text to the screen. The program broadcasts its screen via a Syphon server which can be used in a projection mapping tool like Resolume, vpt8, etc.
Kinect functionality added as well.
